					15-316: Software Foundations of Security and Privacy
				</h3>
                <p class="py-6">
					This class is my favorite of of all the courses I am taking right now. I was introduced
					to some of the concepts taught in the class like information flow and side channels from the intro
					course I took last semester. This class goes into much more detail and introduces how 
					safety policies addressing these issues can be formalized. It has been very interesting 
					to see how we can matematically prove that the program we write will not be vulnerable to
					a certain class of bugs.
                </p>

					15-451: Algorithm Design and Analysis
				</h3>
                <p class="py-6">
					After going through 15-251 and 15-210, the theoretical CS and algorithm courses at CMU,
					I was fully expecting this course to be nearly impossible. To my surprise, I was able 
					to understand most of the concepts after hearing it from lecture. The course is difficult, but
					the foundations provided to me have prepared me well.
				</p>
					<p class="py-6">
					The course starts put by giving us a framework
					for evaluating algorithms, and taught us to ask quesitons such as, how close to the optimal will our
					algorithm's output be? Is there room for improvement, or does the algorithm reach a lower bound in terms of
					space or time? The next part of the course focused on algorithms and data structures
					for common problems in CS such as using Splay-Trees for slightly faster guarantees when the access pattern
					of the inputs are known and pushing the maximum amount of flow. <a class="text-blue-800 hover:underline" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15451/">Previous Course Sites</a>

					17-333: Privacy,Policy, Technology and Law
				</h3>
                <p class="py-6">
					I have to admit, this was a required course for the security and privacy concentration, so I didn't come
					in with the highest expectations. The course description described the course as more of a 
					policy one, and would discuss current privacy laws and their motives. Initially, I was unconvinced that
					policies were a viable solution, seeing that larger companies like Google and Facebook have been 
					harvesting data for a while now even with these laws. After the first few weeks however, I changed my stance.
					The course so far has really shown me that policy can be effective, as things like the GDPR and CCPA are forcing
					companies to actually respect consumer privacy. Additionally, while many issues like web tracking and data aggregation
					remain prevalent, it is only because there are studies attempting to figure out a way to adress these compelx issues
					that is both enforcable and will not bankrupt any businesses. <a class="text-blue-800 hover:underline" href="https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/courses/privpolawtech.html">Previous Course Sites</a>

					I am currently participating in the Secureum Bootcamp to better understand smart contract vulnerabilities
					and how to audit contracts to find such vulnerabilities. The bootcamp is loosely structured,
					giving all participants weekly materials to read as well as optional assignments to help strengthen
					understanding. So far, they have only covered Ethereum and Solidity, but have went into incredible detail
					on both. I have had experience writing smart contracts in Solidity, but have learned so much about the specifis
					of Solidity such as the bytecode instruciton used by the EVM as well as how memory and storage are managed. I am looking
					forward to the audit part of the bootcamp, as I'll finally get to exploit some vulnerabilites with my newfound
					knowledge. <a class="text-blue-800 hover:underline" href="https://secureum.substack.com/">More details</a>
